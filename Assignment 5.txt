SELECT *FROM Orders
WHERE (amt < 1000
       OR NOT (odate ='1990-10-03' 
               AND cnum > 2003));

It will display all tuple from order except date is '1990-10-03' with cnum >2003 or orders
where amt is less then 1000 or it will display all order having amount less then 1000 or having order except on'1990-10-03'

SELECT *FROM Orders
WHERE NOT ((odate = '1990-10-03'
            OR snum>1006)
           AND amt >= 1500);

6) What is a simpler way to write this query?
SELECT snum,

       comm
FROM Salespeople
